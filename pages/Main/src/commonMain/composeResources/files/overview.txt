My research interests lie in 3D vision and neural rendering, particularly for real-time applications in resource-constrained systems. My work also intersects computer graphics algorithms for photorealistic rendering and generative models for visual computing.

I completed my Master's degree within the distinguished Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's COSI Program, hosted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I graduated Class of 2025 with first-class honors and the best-ranked Master's thesis, conducted at Carl Zeiss AG in Germany and under joint supervision with Universit√© Jean Monnet in France.
