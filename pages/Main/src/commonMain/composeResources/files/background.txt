I completed my Master's degree in the distinguished Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's COSI Program at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. As part of the Class of 2025, I graduated with first-class honors and was awarded Best Master's Thesis for my research conducted at Carl Zeiss AG in Germany, under joint supervision with Universit√© Jean Monnet in France.

Prior to COSI, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, graduating with first-class honors and receiving the Gold Medal for outstanding academic performance. My Bachelor's thesis, a multi-platform navigation system using graphics rendering, was supervised Associate Professor, Dr. Cuong Pham-Quoc, Head of the Computer Engineering Department.
